# Info
I use the concept of **"Learning by Doing"**. I just rewrote the existing code little by little to make it easier to learn and understand it



# Credits
This code is inspired by this repo https://github.com/vinaygaba/Learn-Jetpack-Compose-By-Example

If you want to check the equivalent of "Jetpack Compose" check here https://jetpackcompose.app/
